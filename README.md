# piscord

A lightweight Discord gateway for [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). It receives Discord messages, queues them in SQLite, invokes `pi` as a subprocess, and sends responses back — keeping a persistent session per channel.

```bash
npm install -g piscord
piscord setup                 # interactive wizard — walks you through everything
```

That's it. The setup wizard checks prerequisites, asks for your Discord bot token, lets you pick a channel policy, and optionally installs + starts a systemd service. Your bot is live in under a minute.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 20
- **[pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono)** installed and on `PATH`, with login completed (`~/.pi/agent/auth.json`)
- **Discord bot token** — [create one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  - Enable **Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents
  - Bot permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `View Channels`, `Attach Files`

## Features

- **Bridges to your existing `pi`** — shells out to the `pi` binary and reuses your login + model access
- **Per-channel sessions** — each Discord channel gets its own persistent conversation history
- **Channel access policy** — `open` (all channels), `open-trigger` (all channels, @mention required), or `allowlist` (manual registration only)
- **SQLite message queue** — survives crashes, auto-recovers stuck messages
- **Concurrency control** — per-channel serial processing + configurable global limit
- **DM auto-registration** — direct messages work out of the box
- **Discord slash commands** — `/pi status`, `/pi model`, `/pi thinking`, `/pi new`, `/pi stop`
- **Abort command** — `/pi stop` terminates the running task and clears queued messages
- **Attachment relay** — Discord file uploads are downloaded and passed to `pi` via `@file`
- **File sending** — `piscord send` lets pi send files to any Discord channel
- **Scheduled tasks** — cron or one-time tasks that trigger pi sessions on schedule
- **Archive auto-cleanup** — archived sessions are cleaned up after a configurable retention period
- **Typing indicators** — shows "bot is typing" while `pi` processes
- **Message splitting** — handles Discord's 2000-character limit automatically
- **systemd integration** — `piscord daemon install` generates a user service
- **XDG-compliant paths** — config in `~/.config/`, data in `~/.local/share/`

## How It Works

```
Discord ──discord.js──→ Gateway ──pi subprocess──→ Pi Agent
                           │                          │
                         SQLite                  Session dirs
                      (message queue)           (per channel)
```

The gateway **does not embed or replace `pi`**. It finds and runs your installed `pi`:

1. **Binary discovery** — uses `PI_BIN` config or finds `pi` in `PATH`
2. **Auth reuse** — `pi` reads its own `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` when invoked
3. **Model catalog** — the gateway imports the pi SDK to populate slash command autocomplete
4. **Invocation** — each message is processed as `pi --session-dir <dir> --continue -p <message>`

## Channel Policy

During setup you pick one of three policies. This controls how the bot interacts with server channels:

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `open` | All guild channels auto-register on first message. No @mention needed. |
| `open-trigger` | All guild channels auto-register, but only respond when @mentioned. |
| `allowlist` | Only manually registered channels are active. |

- DMs always auto-register when `AUTO_REGISTER_DMS=true` (the default).
- Use `EXCLUDED_CHANNELS` to block specific channels from auto-registration in `open` / `open-trigger` mode.

If you chose `allowlist`, register channels manually:

```bash
piscord register 123456789012345678 "my-server #general" --no-trigger
```

## Slash Commands

The gateway registers a global `/pi` command on Discord:

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `/pi status` | Show model, thinking, session info, token usage |
| `/pi model` | Set the channel's model (autocomplete from pi's available models) |
| `/pi reset-model` | Clear the channel's model override |
| `/pi thinking` | Set thinking level: off / minimal / low / medium / high / xhigh |
| `/pi new` | Start a fresh session for this channel |
| `/pi stop` | Abort the current task and clear queued messages |

## Scheduled Tasks

The gateway has a built-in scheduler that can run pi prompts on a cron schedule or at a specific time. Tasks are injected into the normal message queue, so they use the channel's configured model and thinking level.

### Recurring tasks (cron)

```bash
# Generate a daily summary every morning at 9am UTC
piscord task add \
  --name "daily-report" \
  --schedule "0 9 * * *" \
  --channel dc:123456789 \
  --prompt "Generate today's summary report"

# Run a health check every 6 hours
piscord task add \
  --name "health-check" \
  --schedule "0 */6 * * *" \
  --channel dc:123456789 \
  --prompt "Run system health check and report any issues"
```

### One-time tasks

```bash
# Fire a one-time reminder at a specific time
piscord task add \
  --name "meeting-reminder" \
  --schedule "2026-04-05T14:00:00Z" \
  --channel dc:123456789 \
  --prompt "Remind Colin about the 2pm meeting" \
  --once
```

### Managing tasks

```bash
piscord task list              # List all tasks (shows id, schedule, status)
piscord task disable 1         # Pause a task
piscord task enable 1          # Resume it
piscord task remove 1          # Delete permanently
```

The `--schedule` value uses standard 5-field cron syntax (`minute hour day month weekday`). For one-time tasks (`--once`), pass an ISO 8601 datetime instead.

## File Sending

Pi can send files to Discord channels via the built-in `piscord send` tool:

```bash
piscord send --channel dc:123456789 --file /path/to/report.pdf --text "Here's the report"
piscord send --channel dc:123456789 --file chart.png --file data.csv
```

- Up to 10 files per message (Discord limit)
- Respects `MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` per file
- Works independently — no running gateway required

## systemd Service

The setup wizard offers to install a systemd user service automatically. You can also manage it manually:

```bash
piscord daemon install   # Generate + enable user service
piscord daemon start     # Start
piscord daemon status    # Check status
piscord daemon logs      # Tail journal output
piscord daemon stop      # Stop
piscord daemon uninstall # Remove the service
```

> **Headless servers**: enable user lingering so the service runs without an active login session:
> ```bash
> sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
> ```

## Configuration Reference

Config file: `~/.config/pi-discord-gateway/config.env`

Most users won't need to edit this file directly — `piscord setup` generates it for you. If you do want to tweak advanced settings, you can edit the file manually, or ask your pi to configure it for you.

node dist/cli/index.js setup
```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>pi not found in PATH</strong></summary>

`piscord status` shows "Pi binary: not found".

- Check `pi --version` works in the same shell
- Set `PI_BIN=/full/path/to/pi` in config.env
- Restart: `piscord daemon stop && piscord daemon start`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Missing auth.json</strong></summary>

`piscord status` shows "Pi auth: missing".

- Run `pi` and complete the login flow
- Confirm `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` exists for the same user running the gateway
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>systemd service won't start</strong></summary>

- `piscord daemon status` — check for errors
- `piscord daemon logs` — see journal output
- For headless servers: `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Bot is online but doesn't respond</strong></summary>

- `open` policy: check `EXCLUDED_CHANNELS` doesn't include your channel
- `allowlist` policy: run `piscord channels` — at least one channel must be registered
- For trigger-only channels: mention the bot by name or use `@TriggerName`
- DMs auto-register when `AUTO_REGISTER_DMS=true`
</details>

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Start with tsx (no build needed)
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
npm test             # Run Vitest suite
```

## Security

- Protect `config.env` — it contains your Discord bot token
- Anyone who can message a registered channel can spend your pi usage
- Review attachment size limits before exposing the bot
- Run the service as a normal user, not root
